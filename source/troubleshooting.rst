Data validation warnings

Some of the warnings are related to the user entered information and they guide the user to successfully enter
meaningful parameters. They prevent the user from entering invalid data.

System errors
--------------

Rarely, the system may show an “internal server error” warning, or other unspecified error condition. This means the
system has encountered an abnormal condition and is unable to recover and proceed with the operation.


Steps that can be taken to resolve the error:

1. Make sure that you are successfully logged in the system.

2. Check the input fields. Make sure that the necessary data are entered in the needed format. Refer to the manual
for more information on the input fields and their meaning.

3. Clear the cache, cookies and browser history. Refer to the support pages from the browser that you are using on
information how to perform that.

4. Try with another browser, or try again later.
