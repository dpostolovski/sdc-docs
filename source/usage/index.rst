This section will describe in detail all of the previously mentioned stages that are part of the process to get the
final report. The goal is to get as much information as possible about what performance and what system we want to
operate with. Finally, the analysis will produce better results. The steps must be completed in order, and the user
can not continue to the next one if there are errors on the current page. By continuing to the next page, the system
automatically saves the specification entered.

The user can go back and adjust the entered specification for some of the previous steps, or change them later from
the systems list.
